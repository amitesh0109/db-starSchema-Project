# Databricks End to End Project

Hereâ€™s an improved and professional version of your project description:

---

This project focuses on building a **Star Schema** using customer orders data on **Azure Databricks**. It leverages key Databricks features such as:

* **Unity Catalog** for centralized data governance
* **Auto Loader** for scalable and incremental data ingestion
* **PySpark** for data transformations

Dimensional modeling is implemented with:

* **Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD) Type 1** to build the **Customer Dimension table**
* **SCD Type 2** using **Delta Live Tables (DLT)** to manage historical changes in the **Product-Customer Dimension**

Fact tables are created by applying joins across transformed datasets. The solution is deployed on **Azure Databricks**, with **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2** serving as the storage layer, and other **Azure services** facilitating secure and efficient integration.
